            <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
            <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Allison â€” a multidisciplinary artist with a passion for fashion illustration, embroidery design, and crochet. The Stash is where I bring together all the threads of my creativity, showcasing everything from detailed digital sketches to cozy handmade pieces.</p>
            <p>My work is often inspired by emerging fashion trends, contemporary styles, and the ever-changing world of fast fashion, but I also love weaving in references to anime, TV shows, and films that have left a mark on me. This mix of modern fashion and storytelling allows me to create pieces that feel both current and deeply personal.</p>
            <p>Whether Iâ€™m sketching a bold runway look, crafting a delicate embroidered motif, or crocheting a soft and quirky amigurumi, I aim to express a sense of individuality and playfulness. Everything here is part of my evolving stash â€” a collection of designs that reflect how I see beauty, texture, and character everyday.</p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting The Stash â€” where style is always in rotation ðŸŽµðŸ§µ</p>
